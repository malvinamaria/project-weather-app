# Weather App

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

Oscar- If/else if statements will be the death of me. I spent a lot of time searching a lot of sites for info but in the end, chatting with the animal team was the best way to solve the issue. I couldn't get the weather icons to show up for all of the days, but maybe in the future!

## View it live
